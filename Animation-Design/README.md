## 🎨 Animation Design – Practice Project

🔗 [Live Demo](https://brunhild912.github.io/Web-Projects/Animation-Design/)

This project is a part of my self-learning journey to deepen my understanding of **web animations using JavaScript** and enhance my **HTML/CSS** fundamentals.

### 📌 What I Did:
- Adapted and customised an open-source animation project.
- Practised **DOM manipulation** and **JavaScript-based animations**.
- Explored **timing functions**, **event listeners**, and **interactive elements**.
- Enhanced the styling and layout using **CSS3**.
- Focused on writing clean, understandable, and responsive code.

> 🚀 This project helped me understand how animation works under the hood and built my confidence in adding motion to web interfaces.
